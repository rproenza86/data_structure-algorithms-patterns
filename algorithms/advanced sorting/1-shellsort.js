/**
 * The Shellsort Algorithm
 * ≠
    Shellsort is named after its inventor, Donald Shell. This algorithm is based on the insertion sort
    but is a big improvement over that basic sorting algorithm. Shellsort’s key concept is
    that it compares distant elements first, rather than adjacent elements, as is done in the
    insertion sort. Elements that are far out of place can be put into place more efficiently
    using this scheme than by simply comparing neighboring elements. As the algorithm
    loops through the data set, the distance between each element decreases until, when at
    the end of the data set, the algorithm is comparing elements that are adjacent.
